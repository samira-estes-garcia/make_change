    <h1>Make Change Algorithm</h1>
    <div class="us-form">
        <p>How many combinations are there to make change for the below amount?</p>
        <p>Enter a dollar amount to see all the different combinations that you can make change from using US coins.</p>
        <p>Before you hit submit, press command + option + j to open the developer console and view a table of all the combinations.</p>
        <!-- Make a form to accept input to make change for USD -->
        <form id="form-usd">
            <label for="total" name="total">Enter Amount: $</label>
            <input type="text" name="total" id="total" placeholder="1.00" required/>
            <div class="usd-error"></div>
            <input type="submit" id="submit"/>
        </form>
    </div>
    <div class="anarchy-form">
        <!-- Make a form to accept input for types of currency and how much they're worth -->
        <p>Enter your own currency and the amount to make change!</p>
        <p>Enter the name of the currency, add a comma, and follow up with how much of the currency it takes to make one unit. Add up to 4 currencies and their respective amounts. </p>
        <p>Ex: coin,1.5,arrowhead,3,button,150. This denotes that it takes 1.5 coins to reach one unit, 3 arrowheads to reach one unit and so on. If we were to use US coins, it would be written as "Quarter, 4, Dime, 10, Nickel, 20, Penny, 100".</p>
